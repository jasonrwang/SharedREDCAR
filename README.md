Binder defaults to using Jupyter Notebook, but you can tell it to launch a Jupyter Lab or RStudio instance instead with the instructions here: 

## Files

- `1.0-SharedREDCAR_Example.ipynb` is a notebook with a simple Python script inside

- `.gitignore` is simply a Git file that tells it to ignore temporary Jupyter Notebook artifacts
- `README.md` is to explain what everything is!
